                   need to make informed decisions about risks to health,

                   providing a framework for interdisciplinary
                   collaboration. It is demonstrated with varied examples

  abstract       = {The fear appeal literature is diverse and
                   inconsistent. Existing fear appeal theories explain the
                   positive linear results occurring in many studies, but
                   are unable to explain the boomerang or curvilinear
                   results occurring in other studies. The present work
                   advances a theory integrating previous theoretical
                   perspectives (i.e., Janis, 1967; Leventhal, 1970;
                   Rogers, 1975, 1983) that is based on Leventhal's (1970)
                   danger control/fear control framework. The proposed
                   fear appeal theory, called the Extended Parallel
                   Process Model (EPPM), expands on previous approaches in
                   three ways: (a) by explaining why fear appeals fail;
                   (b) by re-incorporating fear as a central variable; and
                   (c) by specifying the relationship between threat and
                   efficacy in propositional forms. Specific propositions
                   are given to guide future research.},
